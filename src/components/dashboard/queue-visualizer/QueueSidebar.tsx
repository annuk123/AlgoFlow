- FIFO (First In, First Out): The earliest added element is the first to be removed.
- Queue: A linear data structure where insertion happens at the rear and deletion happens from the front.
- Front: The element to be dequeued next.
- Rear: The last element added to the queue.
- Operations:
  - Enqueue: Add element to the rear.
  - Dequeue: Remove element from the front.
  - Peek: View the front element without removing it.
  - IsEmpty: Check if the queue has elements.
- Empty State: Critical edge case, must be handled to prevent errors.`,

    content: `‚öôÔ∏è When to Use a Queue
- Task Scheduling: CPU scheduling, printing jobs.
- Breadth-First Search (BFS): Level-wise traversal in trees and graphs.
- Asynchronous Data Processing: Queues for handling incoming requests.
- Order Preservation: Scenarios where order of processing is critical.
- Multi-threading: Thread-safe queues to manage shared resources.
- Streaming Systems: Processing real-time data efficiently.`,

    title: "Supported Operations",

- Enqueue: Add element to the rear.
- Dequeue: Remove element from the front.
- Peek: View the front element.
- IsEmpty: Check if queue is empty.
- Clear: Remove all elements.
- Traversal: (Optional) Visual walkthrough of the queue.`,

    title: "Advanced Tips & Best Practices",
    content: `üí° Advanced Tips & Best Practices
- Handle empty queue carefully to prevent underflow errors.
- Use queues when order matters and tasks must be processed sequentially.
- Consider a circular queue for efficient memory use in fixed-size queues.
- For high-concurrency applications, use thread-safe or lock-free queues.
- Visualizing helps to debug complex queue-based algorithms.
- Queues generally have O(1) enqueue and dequeue time complexity.`,
